# 4. Ensure that Python 3 is used
RUN ln -sf /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python

# 5. Copy your src/ directory into the container
# should not copy the build/, devel/, or install/ directories from your host machine to your Docker container.
# These directories are generated when you build your Catkin workspace,
# and their contents are specific to the system where you did the build.
COPY ./catkin_ws/src ./src

# 6. Copy the run script and make the executable
COPY ./run.sh ./run.sh
RUN chmod +x ./run.sh

# 7. CHAMP requirement
RUN rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y


# 8. Run catkin_make to build your workspace
# - /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
# This command sources the setup script for the ROS environment.
# This script sets a number of environment variables that ROS uses,
# such as ROS_ROOT, ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, and ROS_MASTER_URI, among others.
# It also adds various ROS tools to your PATH.
RUN /bin/bash -c '. /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash; cd /app; catkin_make clean; catkin_make -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3'

# 9. This command sources the setup script for your catkin workspace
# - This will be overriden by command in docker-compose file if you build the container using compose
# - source /app/devel/setup.bash
# This sets up the environment variables for the packages in your catkin workspace.
# For example, it modifies ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to include the packages in your workspace,
# and it adds any executables in your workspace to your PATH.
